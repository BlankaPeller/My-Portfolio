                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am Blanka Peller. I am from Hungary, but I have lived in Washington State for the past three years. I am most familiar with HTML, CSS, and C#, but I am also knowledgeable with JavaScript. In the last year, I have developed many functioning and complete websites by myself using a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I also enjoy programming small games in C#. In this MIT JavaScript Coding Bootcamp, I got to practice JavaScript and perhaps even learned a few new things. This website or portfolio shows off my work done during this Bootcamp using the code and the skills which were talked about in class, along with my own skills. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy this website.</p>
